# (Smoke) Tests
The tests that are reported in this folder are *basic* and **definitively not enough** to test your solution.

The idea is to have a simple way to compare the output generated by your program against an expected output for simple cases.

I any case you are strongly suggested to use proper testing frameworks and define and commit your own test cases. Test cases might be a good reason to get bonus points.

The tests in this folder assume that MasterMild is configured to use:

- 4-digit codes
- `1234` as secret code
- and 10 retries

Assuming you have compiled the program, a simple test for Java would look like the following:

```
cd closed-map-java
cat ../tests/inputs-1.txt | java MasterMild > results
diff ../tests/expected-output-1.txt results

```

While the same test for JavaScript would look like:

```
cd closed-map-javascript
cat ../tests/inputs-1.txt | node master-mild.js > results
diff ../tests/expected-output-1.txt results
```
